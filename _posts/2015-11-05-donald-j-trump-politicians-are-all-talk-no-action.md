```By Nick Gass on 11/05/2015```

Donald Trump pitches himself as someone who “learned the values of hard work, determination and faith at an early age” in one of two radio ads previewed Thursday exclusively on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

The Trump campaign on Wednesday announced $300,000 in radio ad buys in the early states of New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina.

In the first of two ads, a female narrator intones: “Donald Trump is running for president because politicians are all talk and no action. They will never make our country great again.”
